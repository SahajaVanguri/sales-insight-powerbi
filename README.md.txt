# Sales insight project

Project Overview:
Atliq Hardwares is a computer hardware business facing challenges in increasing revenue amidst a dynamically changing market. To address this, the Sales Director needed a comprehensive dashboard that provides real-time sales insights. This project involved creating a dashboard to help track revenue growth, year-over-year (YOY) trends, and regional sales performance, ultimately aiming to boost revenue by making data-driven decisions.

Situation:
Atliq Hardwares was struggling to scale effectively within a competitive and rapidly evolving market. The business lacked actionable insights that could help in making strategic decisions to increase revenue.
Task / Action:

To overcome these challenges, I performed the following tasks:
Data Analysis: Utilized SQL to extract and analyze relevant sales data.
Dashboard Development: Designed and developed an interactive dashboard using Power BI.
Revenue Tracking: Monitored overall revenue growth.
YOY Trends: Analyzed year-over-year sales trends to identify patterns.
Region-wise Performance: Evaluated sales performance across different regions to uncover growth opportunities.

#Result:
The resulting dashboard provided actionable insights that facilitated quick, data-informed decisions. The dashboard effectively displayed sales trends and allowed the Sales Director to identify key areas for improvement. As a result, it is projected that the dashboard will help raise revenue by at least 7% in the next
